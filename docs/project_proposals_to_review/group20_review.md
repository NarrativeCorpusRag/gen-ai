# Group 20: CookCompass
## Summary
The core objective match users inventory and dietary constraints with the unstructured content of the open web.
CookCompass solves the problem of inefficient and unsafe recipe discovery for individuals with dietary restrictions by utilizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to filter, verify, and synthesize recipes from the Food.
Targets users with hard constraints providing a conversational interface that transforms rigid database.

## Clarity & Coherence
Rate the clarity of each section and identify gaps:
- Users & Goals: Are the target users and their workflows clearly defined?
- Problem Definition: Is the core challenge well-articulated and specific?
- Solution Concept: Is the high-level approach understandable without deep technical knowledge?
- Technical Approach: Are the main technical challenges clearly identified?

## Relevance & Appropriateness
Does the use of generative AI make sense in the proposed project?
